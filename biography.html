<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>
        Max Emilian Verstappen, born on 30 September 1997 in Hasselt, Belgium, is a Dutch Formula One driver who races under the Dutch flag. 
        The son of former Formula One driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian karting champion Sophie Kumpen, Max grew up surrounded by motorsport from an early age. 
        He began karting at the age of four, showing exceptional speed and racecraft that quickly made him a prodigy in junior categories. 
        Despite being eligible to race for Belgium, Verstappen chose the Netherlands, representing his father’s heritage.

        Off the track, Max is known for his calm yet competitive demeanor, an intense focus on performance, and a dedication to constant improvement. 
        He is passionate about sim racing, often competing online in high-level events, and is involved in charitable causes. 
        Max’s relentless pursuit of excellence, combined with his natural driving talent, has made him one of the most feared and respected drivers on the grid. 
        By 2025, he had already secured multiple World Championships, setting numerous records and establishing himself as one of Formula 1’s all-time greats.

<h2 id="career">Career</h2>
<p>
        Max Verstappen’s career trajectory has been nothing short of extraordinary. After dominating in karting, he moved to single-seaters in 2014, racing in the FIA European Formula 3 Championship where he won 10 races and finished third overall. 
        His meteoric rise caught the attention of the Red Bull Junior Team, and later that year, he was signed by Scuderia Toro Rosso (now AlphaTauri) for the 2015 Formula One season, making him the youngest driver in F1 history at just 17 years old.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2016, Max was promoted to Red Bull Racing after just four races, replacing Daniil Kvyat. In his very first race for Red Bull, the Spanish Grand Prix, he took a stunning victory, becoming the youngest race winner in F1 history. 
        Over the following years, Verstappen’s aggressive yet calculated driving style earned him a reputation as a fearless racer. 
        By 2021, he claimed his first World Championship after a dramatic season-long battle with Lewis Hamilton. 
        In 2022 and 2023, he dominated the field, breaking multiple records including most wins in a season and most consecutive victories.
    </p>
    <p>
        Entering the 2025 season, Verstappen continued his dominance, winning the opening races and extending his legacy as one of the sport’s most consistent and formidable champions. 
        His partnership with Red Bull and chief engineer Gianpiero Lambiase has become one of the most successful driver-engineer pairings in F1 history.

<h2 id="debut">Debut Race</h2>
<p>
        Max Verstappen’s Formula One debut took place at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. At just 17 years and 166 days old, he broke the record for the youngest driver to start a Formula One race. 
        Driving for Toro Rosso, Max impressed throughout the weekend, showing maturity far beyond his years. He qualified 12th on the grid, a remarkable feat for a rookie in a midfield car.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the race, Verstappen displayed his aggressive overtaking skills and race awareness, battling experienced drivers with confidence. Unfortunately, his debut ended with a mechanical failure, forcing him to retire before the checkered flag. 
        Despite the setback, his performance caught the attention of the entire paddock, with many predicting a stellar career ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
        This debut marked the beginning of a new era in Formula 1, as Verstappen’s entry demonstrated that young drivers could compete at the highest level if given the opportunity. 
        It also set the stage for his rapid ascent to Red Bull Racing and his eventual dominance of the sport.
